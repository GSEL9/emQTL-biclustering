# emQTL-clustering
Comparing the performance of biclustering algorithms applied to a data matrix containing of Bonferroni corrected p-values. The p-values are calculated from Pearson's correlations between DNA methylated CpG data and gene expression data. The aim of the clustering is to detect relations between genes and CpG methylation level to elucidate biological relevance of emQTL.
