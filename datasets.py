"""
Synthetic test data generators.

Test data is generated in resemblance to the experimental datasets in order to
evaluate the performance of the applied biclustering algorithms.

The goal is to assess the algorithms capability of restoring the original test
clusters. The test clusters are generated in similar proportions that was found
to be biologically relevant in the experimental dataset.
